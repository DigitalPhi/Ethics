## Week 4

Brief reminder of central elements of classical utilitarianism (as articulated by Bentham) in which we consider the following: What is the utilitarian account of the principles upon which we ought to act?  Where does it locate the philosophical basis of our ideas of right and wrong?  What is the source of attraction of the utilitarian conception of morality? The focus of the meeting is, however, the following question raised by Peter Singer: How much, if at all, must we help others?
