## Discussion questions

Students are expected to do the all of the assigned reading prior to each meeting. In preparation students should write up a substantial question about one of the readings. Please bring a copy to class. We are a large group. It is even more important, then, that everyone arrive ready to contribute.

Contribute any comments, questions or passing thoughts [here](discussion.md) It is a page for real time collaborative editing with lots of additional features. Just click the link and write.
