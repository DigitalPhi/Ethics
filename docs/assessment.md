* An essay of 2500 words (PHIL2047).

## Formative essay

You are encouraged to write a formative essay during the reading week. Questions will be distributed in advance. Any of these can also serve to set the topic for your summative essay.

<!-- * Topics available here [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ca1m5bf5n06fom1/essay-topics-formative.pdf?dl=0). (Additional questions may be included later in the term.)
  - Due date is week 8 of the autumn term. -->

## Discussion questions

Students are expected to do the all of the assigned reading prior to each meeting. In preparation students should write up a substantial question about one of the readings. Please bring a copy to class. We are a large group. It is even more important, then, that everyone arrive ready to contribute.

Contribute any comments, questions or passing thoughts [here](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Ethics2047). It is a page for real time collaborative editing with lots of additional features. Just click the link and write.
