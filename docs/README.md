> Welcome! This is the course page for Ethics PHIL2047 (2018-19, term 2).

Precise contents may vary slightly by year. Some topics include: the nature of the good, egoism, utilitarian accounts of right and wrong action, virtue (esp. justice and benevolence), equality, partiality and impartiality, responsibility and moral luck. This module is meant to be exploratory within the limits of reason and polite society. Let's all do our best.


## Announcements

All course material will be available on this website shortly. This module aims to be orderly and edifying. Who knows, it may even help us to live better lives. <sub><small>January 7</small></sub>

For our introductory meeting please read the following texts:



<!-- For those who expressed interest in writing on the content of the last scheduled meeting, I've added a few questions to the list of essay topics [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/30tvn21e7x25w3x/essay_topics.pdf?dl=0). In addition, I'm holding extended office hours this Wednesday (May 2nd from 1500 to 1800). You're welcome to drop-by.<sub style="color:red"><small>Posted April 30</small></sub>


My office hours for term 3 are Wednesdays 1500-1600. I will be in my office Monday 23 April from 1500-1700 in case you would like to drop-by to discuss the summative essay. Given sufficient interest I will schedule additional drop-in hours.<sub><small>Posted April 21</small></sub>


The deadline for the summative essay is *Tuesday 8 May at 1600*. Additional material has been added below. I will add a couple more sets of notes, a sample essay from another year, and possible additional essay questions. If you'd like to propose your own, please be in contact with me and Alec.
<small>Posted April 16</small></sub>


The deadline for the summative essay was originally set for Monday 23 April 2018, 4pm. I have requested that it be extended by two weeks to Monday 7 May 2018 4pm. If the request is granted, as I expect it will be, the new deadline will be registered on the Turnitin/Moodle page. There will *not* be a blanket response from the department. For offical confirmation you will need to refer to the submission deadlines on Moodle/TurnitIn for the relevant module you are taking, in this case PHIL2047. I expect to hear definitively Monday or Tuesday of this next week (April 9 or 10). <sub><small>March 29</small></sub>

Over the next couple days I will post additional course materials (handout, notes and likely futher essay topics). I will have special drop-in office hours early in the week beginning April 23. More details will be posted on our course website as the time approaches. <sub><small>March 29</small></sub>



For our meeting of March 20th please be prepared to discuss Philippa Foot, 'The problem of abortion and the doctrine of double effect' and in addition Judith Thomson, 'The trolley problem'. There are links to texts and handouts on the schedule of topics and readings. <sub><small>March 20</small></sub>


The due date for the summative (final) essay is *April 23rd 2018*. This date for summative essays is common to all term two philosophy modules. For more detail please see the Philosophy BA assessment space [link](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14303).  <sub><small>March 6</small></sub>

Given the continuation of the UCU strike action I'll be adding further material and plugins to the website in the coming days. Various handouts as well as a [collaborative writing platform](discussion.md)have already been added. More is to come.<sub><small>March 5</small></sub>

As the strike continues, please check the schedule for regular updates of course material, especially handouts and readings. I hope very much that we will be able to meet next Tuesday, March 6! I will post further announcements in the coming days. In addition I will add a chat room for discussion. Check back soon.<sub><small>February 28</small></sub>

<!-- These classes are not mandatory, so you do not have to come. However, you are strongly encouraged to do so! Last year the students found them very beneficial. We had some really excellent in depth discussions about the material. On the whole, we cover the same terrain as the texts set for class reading. The sessions are an opportunity for you to ask questions you didn't get to ask in class, or take further lines of inquiry which you weren't able to in the full group. -->
