> Welcome! This is the course page for Ethics PHIL2047 (2017-18, term 2).

Precise contents may vary slightly by year. Some topics include: the nature of the good, egoism, utilitarian accounts of right and wrong action, virtue (esp. justice and benevolence), equality, partiality and impartiality, responsibility and moral luck. This module is meant to be exploratory within the limits of reason and polite society. Let's all do our best.

## Announcements

Look for announcements here! 

Apologies for the delay -- H3N2 ('aussie flu') has been interfering with philosophy and all other thought since Friday. Essays topics are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/30tvn21e7x25w3x/essay_topics.pdf?dl=0). <sub><small>February 13</small></sub>

The first announcement is this: all the course material will be available on this website very soon. Do not worry. This class will be orderly and edifying. Who knows, it may even help us to live better lives. <sub><small>January 9</small></sub>


<!--A few important announcements <sub><small>November 24</small></sub>
- I've posted additional office hours each week to discuss among other things your plans for the summative essay. Access the calendar through my [webpage](http://www.douglaslavin.org/)
  - If there are materials you would like to discuss please upload them [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/oY2JI7TC4oIfUD1gtMsb) a couple days in advance of our meeting.
- As Alec said, I'm planning to have the make-up session during Alec's usual slot on Monday.

<!-- These classes are not mandatory, so you do not have to come. However, you are strongly encouraged to do so! Last year the students found them very beneficial. We had some really excellent in depth discussions about the material. On the whole, we cover the same terrain as the texts set for class reading. The sessions are an opportunity for you to ask questions you didn't get to ask in class, or take further lines of inquiry which you weren't able to in the full group. -->


## Course materials

All the substantive course content will be available on this course website. There may be a few, minor changes going forward.

A folder with assigned and supplemental readings is available here [folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bwz4x8b77j71hna/AAC9IwTHnPbJHQmQSbtxjVrXa?dl=0). You will find links to individual readings and handouts in the detailed schedule of topics [here](schedule.md).

We will use the [UCL Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=19062) to send email announcements and as the portal for submitting and receiving summative essays.
